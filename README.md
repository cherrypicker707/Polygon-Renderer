**Polygon renderer** is my simple framework made with C, GLFW and OpenGL, which allows to create a window and render some simple polygons on it.

# Building
This project utilizes OpenGL 4.6, you need to create `lib` directory and put glad files in it. Additionally you need to have GLFW installed. Then you can just build it with CMake.
